Data Types:
-->Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
-->It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
-->Since everything is an object in Python programming,
-data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

--> int

--> float
--> boolean
--> string
Data Structure:

A data structure is a collection of data type 'values'
-which are stored and organized in such a way that it allows for efficient access and modification

*** String is an Exception one why because we can use string as data type and Data structure.
*** In we can store one character and also can group of characters.
*** EX: x = "a" or x = 'a'
        x = "Karthi"or x = 'Karthi'
--> String
--> List
--> tuple
--> Set
--> Dictionary
