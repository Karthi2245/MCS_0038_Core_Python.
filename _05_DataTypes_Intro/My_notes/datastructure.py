Data structure:
->Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently

->In Python, we have four built-in data structures:
    ->List
    ->Tuple
    ->Dictionary
    ->Set

There are two types of data structures:

->Primitive data structure
->Non-primitive data structure

Primitive Data structure:
--------------------------
The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.

Non-Primitive Data structure:
------------------------------
The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:(Array,list,tuple,set,dictionary)

->Linear data structure
->Non-linear data structure

Operations
Searching: We can search for any element in a data structure.

Sorting: We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.

Insertion: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.

Updation: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.

Deletion: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.
