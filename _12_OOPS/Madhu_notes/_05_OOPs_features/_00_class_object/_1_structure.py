OOPs concepts:
--------------------
Class Object
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction


Encapsulation :  Binding the data members and 
                             member methods into single entity
                - data members   ==> Fields
                - member methods ==> Methods
                Ex: Class, object
                
                             Logical     Physical 
                             ----------------------
                    Class    Fields      Methods
                    object   Methods     Fields
                
Abstraction    : Hiding implementation details and exposing only method signature 

Abstraction   :      Class          -  0% abstraction
                     Abstract class -  0% to 100% abstraction
                     Interface      - 100%  abstraction

class,object

1. Encapsulation :
-----------------
Definition: Binding the data members & member methods into single entity

entity         : class/object
data members   : Fields/Variables/Attributes  (class,instance variables)
member methods : Methods (Instance Methods,Class Methods,Static Methods)

madhu = Employee(100,'Madhu N, 15000)

Class  ===> Logical  -- DATA    Physical -- METHODS
Object ===> Physical -- DATA    Logical  -- METHODS (Through method access)

Ex : class is an example for encapsulation
     object is also an example


madhu = Employee1(100,"MadhuN",15000)

2. Abstraction :
---------------
Hiding the implementation details in the methods of  a class

In a "Normal class" Abstraction is 0%        # all concrete methods
In "Abstract Class" Abstraction is 0-100 %   # 1. all concrete methods,
                                               2. all abstract methods
                                               3. Comb of concrete+abstract methods
In an "Interface"   Abstraction is 100%      # all abstract methods

During inheritance : Normalclass,

3. Inheritance :
---------------
super class, sub class mechanism

4. Polymorphism :
---------------
    - Static Polymorphism  -- Method overloading
    - Dynamic Polymorphism -- Method overriding

'''
 1. Class Defined and provided special method i.e, 
   __init__(constructor) method to initialize instance variables, 
    define respective methods to get the BEHAVIOR
2.  Create object for the respective class.
        Internally 
         Python creates empty object for us,and gives reference to self parameter
         Reamining parameters, we are passing the arguments
         In empty object, instance variables will be initialized with the given data
3. Finally whole object reference will be given to LHS
4. We can perform method calls using created object

class var                  instance var
-------------------------- ----------------------------
while loading class        at the time of object creation

class var                  instance var
class methods              instance methods

instance variables cant be used inside class method**

++ Within instance methods we can use class variables*****
viceversa is not True ==> within class methods we can't use instance varibales
