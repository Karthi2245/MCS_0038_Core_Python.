'''
Debugging:
-->
Debugging can be done in two ways:
using breakpoint technique
by importing pdb module

breakpoint technique:
keeping the points at starting line and ending line which you want to debug and can see the flow of execution
line by line

pdb module:
import pdb module before the line where you want to start to debug
and after end line we would write pdb.set_trace() upto where we want to debug the program

commmads:
 n --> execute next line
 c --> complete execution
 l --> list 3 lines before and after current line
 s --> step into function call
 b --> show list of break points
 b[int] --> set break point at line number
 b[func] --> break at function name
 cl --> clear all break points
 cl[int] --> clear break point at line number '''
