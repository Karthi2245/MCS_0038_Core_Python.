MATRICES:
=============
row
column
         ___             ___
        |   10   25    5    |    # A[1][2]
        |                   |
A    =  |   32   12    7    |
        |                   |
        |__ 14   20    15 __|

Above is 3X3 matrix : Means 3 rows 3 columns   A[3X3]

A[2][1]  ==> 2nd row,1st column ==> 32
A[1][3]  ==> 1st row,3rd column ==>  5
A[2][2]  ==> 2nd row,2nd column ==> 12
Addition & Subtraction:
The two matrices must be the same size, i.e. the rows must match in size, and the columns must match in size.

Multiplication:
To multiply a matrix by another matrix we need to do the "dot product" of rows and columns 
The "Dot Product" is where we multiply matching members, then sum up.

Identity Matrix:
The "Identity Matrix" is the matrix equivalent of the number "1"

Dividing:
Well we don't actually divide matrices, we do it this way:
A/B = A × (1/B) = A × B-1
where B-1 means the "inverse" of B.
